## Introduction
This project aims at finding the statistical law of neuron branches, here I provided a pipeline to get the skeleton and statistical analysis .csv files from input .h5 neurons. 

## Installation
Please refer to [donglaiw/ibexHelper](https://github.com/donglaiw/ibexHelper/tree/master/script) to finish the installation.

## Initial skeleton
This initial skeleton results can be got from [donglaiw/ibexHelper/script/demo.py](https://github.com/donglaiw/ibexHelper/tree/master/script). So please install the package first. For large scale analysis, put my demo_largescale.py inside ibexHelper/script/, change the path, and:
                      
                      python demo_largescale.py

## Contact
The data is from [Lichtman Lab](https://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, and the pipeline is built by [Xingyu Liu](https://github.com/charlotte12l), summer intern at Harvard University.
